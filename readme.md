## Introduction

These Arduino projects explore different aspects of embedded systems development. They provide practical examples of how to interface sensors, control actuators, and build interactive devices using the Arduino platform. I've created these projects to [your motivation for creating them, e.g., learn about embedded systems, share my knowledge, build useful gadgets].

## Projects

This section provides a brief overview of each project in the repository. For more detailed information on a specific project, please refer to the project's folder and the code within.

*   `[Project Name 1]`: [Short description of the project. E.g., `BlinkLED`: A simple project that blinks an LED connected to an Arduino pin.]
*   `[Project Name 2]`: [Short description of the project. E.g., `UltrasonicSensor`: Demonstrates how to use an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance.]
*   `[Project Name 3]`: [Short description of the project. E.g., `ServoMotorControl`: Controls a servo motor using an Arduino.]
*   ... (List all your projects)

## How to Use

Each project contains the Arduino sketch (`.ino` file) and any necessary wiring diagrams or documentation.

1.  **Hardware:** Gather the required hardware components, including the Arduino board, sensors, actuators, and other electronic components.  Refer to the project's documentation for a list of required components.
2.  **Wiring:** Connect the components according to the wiring diagram provided in the project folder. Double-check all connections to avoid damage.
3.  **Software:** Open the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) on your computer.
4.  **Upload:** Open the `.ino` file for the desired project in the Arduino IDE. Select the correct Arduino board and port. Compile and upload the code to your Arduino board.
5.  **Run:** Once the code is uploaded, the project should start running. Observe the behavior of the circuit and the output of the project.

## Dependencies

These projects may require specific Arduino libraries. You can install them using the Arduino Library Manager within the Arduino IDE.

1.  Open the Arduino IDE.
2.  Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...
3.  Search for the required library (e.g., `LiquidCrystal`, `Ultrasonic`).
4.  Install the library.

[List any specific libraries used by your projects. For example:]

*   `LiquidCrystal` library for LCD displays.
*   `Ultrasonic` library for ultrasonic sensors.
*   `Servo` library for servo motors.
